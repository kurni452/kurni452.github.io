		<p>On September 6, 2001, Postmasters Gallery in New York opened a solo exhibition of three projection-based works by Wolfgang Staehle, each featuring a single, iconic architectural site—the television tower in Berlin, the Comburg Benedictine monastery near Stuttgart, and a panorama of the lower Manhattan skyline—with a stationary webcam transmitting a live image to the gallery in New York.</p>

		<p>The webcasts were intended to be contemplative studies of place, but shortly after the opening, the latter work unintentially documented and presented the violent alteration of New York’s skyline in the attacks on the World Trade Center. The work is not shown on the web, but can be shown in gallery exhibitions as a 48- or 72-hour loop.</p>
