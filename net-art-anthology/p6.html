		<p>“In Germany it was 1pm, and in New York it was 7 in the morning. I never saw that in New York. I’m never up at 7 am to watch the sun rise. In a way, this gave me an incredibly visceral experience of synchronicity, of the networking of the whole damn planet...This instantaneousness, this compression of space and time.” 
		<br>— Wolfgang Staehle</p>

		<p>“Around noon that day in New York, my collaborator Jan Gerber and I went to the gallery to find two friends [nettime moderator Ted Byfield and art critic/hacker Blackhawk] sitting on the floor and watching the scene unfold. One said, “Oh, Wolfgang, this is a really important piece now.” I said, “What do you mean—it wasn’t before?” The other friend said, “No, it’s ruined now, its whole meaning is changed.” I said, “You’re both nuts.” I just set up a camera, and of course things can happen.”</p>
