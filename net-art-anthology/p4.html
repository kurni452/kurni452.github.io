		<p>Untitled is an offshoot of Staehle’s earlier work Empire 24/7, which presented a live feed—capturing a still image every four seconds–of the Empire State Building in New York City from the New York office of The Thing, the online community founded by Staehle in 1991.</p>

		<p>Empire 24/7 was shown at ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany as a part of the 1999 exhibition “net_condition.”</p>
